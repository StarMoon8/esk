This repo will accept any fresh takes/ideas that are creative in terms of encryption. Must be in rust, have a very small codebase, and be different than the zillions of already established practices. Do YOU have what it takes to make something creative with encryption? (if you do not know how to code in rust just have ai write your code for you). 

This repo is just screwing around with xor encryption and deteministic key making and some other encryption basics. A deterministic key that is encrypted using another deterministic key would take quantum ai robots about 5 more seconds to decrypt, but its not a bad idea. It is a mix of being user friendly, not having to store keys, and data integrity. If it buys you 5 seconds and it took 1 second to implement- that is still a net gain of 4 secs, dammit! (lol)


AES either was or will be cracked (in less than 1 minute)- that is for sure. To make aes post-quantum safe- i say why take chances? Do a round of AES with a somewhat proven aes tool like https://github.com/str4d/rage . Then use the otp (one time pad) method over the encrypted file. As such, your file should be quite quantum safe, and hella tough for quantum Ai to decrypt. (unless you are on windows or are connected to the internet-, in which case any key you use is known, any passwords you use are also known... and trying to encrypt anything is just silly. lol)

The OTP method is simple and the best (uncrackable in theory) method known, but it is extremely tough to practice in real life. Any slip up like using the key twice diminishes the superior quality of the true otp method. The OTP algo itself is extremely simple, the practicality of properly implementing the otp method is not user friendly or easy. 

Encryption itself is a simple file operation that 5th grade school children can understand. The tough part is encrypting things that can not be decrypted by anyone else. That is where the PhD level thinking is required.


All Encryption is rather crude. Future versions might make it impossible except for a single user to decrypt just by looking at it- but that is far away. For now, encryption is in the stone ages. For the human brain, something as stupid as a Caesar cipher can stump most people. To encrypt info from ai, it will take more than that.

In the end, any encrypted file is simply in a lang that you do not know yet, and learning the lang would not be efficient, because you would need to learn another lang to decode the next file. As such, encryption is not really changing the content of the file, it is just showing it in a different spoken lang that no one invented yet.

The ultimate encrypted message (proven unbreakable beyond theory) is one that was never meant to be decrypted to anything discernable. In other words... a fake encrypted message keeps your foe busy while they try to solve an impossible cypher.

In closing, if you wasted your time reading all of this, you really need a hobby or something (lol) .
