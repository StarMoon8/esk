AES either was or will be cracked (in 1 minute)- that is for sure. To make aes post-quantum safe- i say why take chances? Do a round of AES with a somewhat proven aes implemantation https://github.com/str4d/rage . Then use the otp (one time pad) method over the encrypted file. As such, your file should be quite quantum safe, and hella tough for quantum Ai to decrypt. (unless you are on windows, in which case any key you use is known, any passwords you use are also known... and trying to encrypt anything is just silly.  lol)
