# XOR CLI Tool with Deterministic Key Generation

This is a command-line utility written in Rust that performs XOR-based encryption and decryption using a deterministic key derived from a user-provided password. The key is generated using repeated hashing to ensure it is as long as the file to be encrypted or decrypted, without repetition.

## Features

- Symmetric encryption/decryption using XOR operation.
- Deterministic key generation using repeated hashing based on a user-provided password.
- In-memory processing, suitable for large files if sufficient RAM is available.
- Simple and concise codebase for easy understanding.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Rust and Cargo installed. You can get them using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## Building the Project

1. Clone this repository or create a new project:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd xor
   ```

2. Build the project in release mode:
   
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. The compiled executable will be available in the `target/release` directory.

## Usage

The tool requires an input file, an output file, and a password. The same command can be used for both encryption and decryption because XOR is symmetric.

```bash
./target/release/xor <input_file> <output_file> <password>
```

### Example

To encrypt a file:

```bash
./target/release/xor plaintext.txt encrypted.txt mypassword
```

To decrypt the encrypted file, run the same command with the encrypted file as input:

```bash
./target/release/xor encrypted.txt decrypted.txt mypassword
```

If the password is correct, the `decrypted.txt` file will have the same content as `plaintext.txt`.

## How It Works

- **Key Generation**: The key is generated by repeatedly hashing the password along with a counter using the SHA-256 hash function. This ensures that the key is deterministic and as long as the input file, without repeating any part of the password.
- **XOR Operation**: The XOR operation is applied byte-by-byte between the file data and the corresponding key byte. This makes the encryption and decryption processes symmetric: applying XOR again with the same key restores the original content.

## Limitations and Security Considerations

- This tool is not secure for highly sensitive data. The key is derived deterministically from the password, and the XOR approach is vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks if the same key (password) is used for multiple files.
- The use of XOR encryption and deterministic key generation makes this more of an obfuscation technique than a strong encryption scheme.
- Modern cryptographic libraries like AES are recommended for serious use cases where security is a priority.
