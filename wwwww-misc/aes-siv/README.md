# AES-SIV Encryption App

## Overview
This application is designed for the encryption and decryption of files using **AES-SIV** (Synthetic Initialization Vector), a highly secure and nonce misuse-resistant encryption algorithm. The app is built in Rust and provides a simple command-line interface to generate keys, encrypt files, and decrypt files. AES-SIV offers a robust approach to file encryption, particularly useful for situations where data integrity and security are critical.

AES-SIV is an **authenticated encryption mode**, which means that it not only encrypts your data but also verifies its integrity during decryption, ensuring that it has not been altered or tampered with. This makes AES-SIV especially useful for protecting sensitive information, such as executables, system files, and top-secret data.

### Key Features
- **AES-SIV Encryption**: Uses AES-SIV, which is resistant to nonce misuse, meaning repeated use of the same key and nonce won't compromise security.
- **File Processing**: Encrypts and decrypts complete files while ensuring data integrity, making it suitable for sensitive or even top-secret files.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The app is structured around the `clap` command-line parsing library, making it easy to use and integrate into scripts.
- **Cross-Platform**: Developed in Rust, meaning it can be compiled and run on various platforms, such as Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## How to Use the Application

### 1. Generate a Key
The first step is to generate a key. This key is used for both encryption and decryption and is stored in a file called `key.key`. To generate a key, use the following command:

```sh
cargo run -- gen-key
```

This will create a file called `key.key` in the current directory. **Keep this key secure**, as it is required to decrypt any files that you encrypt.

### 2. Encrypt a File
To encrypt a file, use the `encrypt` subcommand. You will need to specify the input file (the file to be encrypted) and the output file (where the encrypted data will be saved).

```sh
cargo run -- encrypt [input_file] [output_file]
```

Example:

```sh
cargo run -- encrypt example.txt example.enc
```

This will encrypt `example.txt` and save the encrypted data to `example.enc`.

### 3. Decrypt a File
To decrypt a file, use the `decrypt` subcommand. You will need to provide the encrypted file as input and specify the name for the output (decrypted) file.

```sh
cargo run -- decrypt [input_file] [output_file]
```

Example:

```sh
cargo run -- decrypt example.enc decrypted.txt
```

This will decrypt `example.enc` and save the result to `decrypted.txt`.

## Compiling for Production and Running the Executable

In a production environment, the application will typically be compiled into a standalone executable. Here are the steps to compile the application for production use and then run it from the compiled executable.

### 1. Compile the Application for Production
To compile the app as an optimized release build, use the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

This command will create an optimized executable in the `target/release` directory. The `--release` flag ensures that the application is compiled with optimizations enabled, making it suitable for production use.

### 2. Locate the Executable
After running the `cargo build --release` command, the compiled executable will be located at:

```
target/release/aes_siv_encryption_app
```

### 3. Run the Executable
Once the application is compiled, you can run it directly from the command line, without needing to use `cargo`. Here is how you can run the different commands:

#### Generate a Key
```sh
./target/release/aes_siv_encryption_app gen-key
```

#### Encrypt a File
To encrypt a file using the compiled executable:

```sh
./target/release/aes_siv_encryption_app encrypt [input_file] [output_file]
```

Example:

```sh
./target/release/aes_siv_encryption_app encrypt example.txt example.enc
```

#### Decrypt a File
To decrypt a file using the compiled executable:

```sh
./target/release/aes_siv_encryption_app decrypt [input_file] [output_file]
```

Example:

```sh
./target/release/aes_siv_encryption_app decrypt example.enc decrypted.txt
```

### Deployment Considerations
- **Portable Executable**: The compiled binary in the `target/release` directory is a standalone executable, which means it can be copied and deployed to other systems, as long as they meet the required runtime dependencies.
- **Cross-Compilation**: Rust also allows you to cross-compile your application for different platforms if you need to run it on an operating system other than your development environment.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that any environment-related dependencies (such as setting up correct file permissions or paths) are properly handled when deploying the executable.

## Using the Standalone Executable

After compiling the application, you can use the standalone executable independently of the Rust toolchain. Here is how you can use the executable in a production environment without relying on `cargo`:

### 1. Running the Executable
Navigate to the directory where the compiled executable is located. You will find the executable at:

```
target/release/aes_siv_encryption_app
```

You can copy this executable to any location you prefer, or to another machine, provided the necessary runtime dependencies are satisfied.

### 2. Generate a Key Using the Standalone Executable
To generate an encryption key using the standalone executable, use the following command:

```sh
./aes_siv_encryption_app gen-key
```

This command will create a key file named `key.key` in the current directory.

### 3. Encrypt a File Using the Standalone Executable
To encrypt a file, run the following command:

```sh
./aes_siv_encryption_app encrypt [input_file] [output_file]
```

Example:

```sh
./aes_siv_encryption_app encrypt example.txt example.enc
```

This will encrypt `example.txt` and save the encrypted data to `example.enc`.

### 4. Decrypt a File Using the Standalone Executable
To decrypt a file, use the following command:

```sh
./aes_siv_encryption_app decrypt [input_file] [output_file]
```

Example:

```sh
./aes_siv_encryption_app decrypt example.enc decrypted.txt
```

This will decrypt `example.enc` and save the result to `decrypted.txt`.

### Benefits of the Standalone Executable
- **Independence from Rust Toolchain**: The compiled executable can be used on any compatible machine without needing Rust installed, making it easy to distribute and deploy.
- **Ease of Use**: Users do not need to understand Rust or `cargo` to run the app, simplifying usage in production environments or for non-developer users.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: The executable can be integrated into automation scripts, scheduled tasks, or used in any other scenario where a command-line tool is suitable.

## Design Considerations and Security Overview

### Full-File Encryption
The current implementation reads the entire file into memory before processing it. This approach is chosen for **security and simplicity**:
- **Authenticated Encryption Integrity**: AES-SIV is an authenticated encryption mode, which means it ensures both the **confidentiality** and **integrity** of the data. For AES-SIV to verify the integrity of the entire file, it must process the whole file as a single unit, which requires loading the entire file into memory.
- **Security Advantages**: Processing the entire file at once allows AES-SIV to generate a **single authentication tag** for the entire data set, ensuring that any modification, even a single byte, will cause decryption to fail. This makes it highly suitable for encrypting sensitive files where **any tampering must be detected**.

### Why Not Chunk-Based Processing?
For very large files, some might consider a chunk-based approach to save on memory usage. However, chunking the data would involve splitting the file into parts and encrypting each part independently. While this could help reduce memory requirements, it has significant downsides:
- **Integrity Trade-Off**: With chunk-based encryption, the full integrity of the file cannot be guaranteed as easily. Each chunk would have its own integrity check, but an attacker could theoretically modify the order or content of individual chunks without being detected if the system does not implement additional integrity checks.
- **AES-SIV's Strengths**: AES-SIV is specifically designed to provide nonce misuse resistance and authenticated encryption, making it ideal for applications where **security cannot be compromised**. By encrypting the whole file as a single unit, you are leveraging the algorithm's strengths to their fullest potential.

### Hardware Considerations
If you have a powerful machine, such as one with an **Intel i9-14th generation processor** and **64 GB of DDR5 RAM**, you are well equipped to handle large files with the current implementation. For instance, encrypting or decrypting a **10 GB file** is feasible on such hardware without running into memory issues. In scenarios where you have the hardware to match the task, it makes more sense to leverage that power to keep the **encryption consistently secure** rather than compromising on security for the sake of fitting the software to lower hardware capabilities.

### Realistic Use Cases
- **Sensitive Files**: This app is suitable for encrypting sensitive files, including personal documents, legal records, or backups that need to be protected from unauthorized access.
- **Top Secret Data**: Given the use of AES-SIV, which provides strong encryption and integrity guarantees, the app can realistically be used for high-security purposes, such as encrypting top-secret files or data that must remain confidential and unaltered.
- **Executables and System Files**: AES-SIV is also ideal for encrypting executable files because it does not modify the structure of the file by adding nonces or other metadata directly into the content, which could otherwise corrupt the file. This makes it a good fit for encrypting and protecting executables.

## How AES-SIV Encrypts and Decrypts
For those curious about the internals of how AES-SIV works, here is a detailed breakdown of the encryption and decryption process:

### 1. Key Generation
- The app uses a **512-bit key** for encryption, generated using `rand::thread_rng()`. This key is crucial for both encryption and decryption, and its security directly impacts the security of your data.

In this application, AES-SIV uses a 64-byte (512-bit) key. The reason for this key length is that AES-SIV requires a double-length key:
- The first 32 bytes are used for AES encryption.
- The second 32 bytes are used for SIV (Synthetic Initialization Vector) mode.

This double-length key provides additional security properties compared to other modes of AES, ensuring both confidentiality and authenticity. The combination of these two keys helps ensure that the data is both encrypted and protected from tampering, which is crucial for secure and authenticated encryption operations.

### 2. Encryption Process
- **Synthetic Initialization Vector (SIV)**: During encryption, AES-SIV first calculates a **synthetic IV** from the key, plaintext, and any associated data (AAD). This IV is deterministic, meaning that for a given input, it will always produce the same IV. This synthetic IV helps to prevent nonce misuse issues.
- **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-SIV then uses this synthetic IV to encrypt the plaintext and generate the ciphertext. Along with encryption, AES-SIV computes an **authentication tag** that ensures the ciphertext's integrity. If any part of the ciphertext is altered, decryption will fail.
- **Output**: The encrypted file is written to the specified output location, and the synthetic IV is implicitly used without the need to store or manage it separately.

### 3. Decryption Process
- **Recreate the Synthetic IV**: During decryption, AES-SIV recalculates the synthetic IV using the same method as during encryption. This process relies on the key, associated data, and ciphertext, ensuring that any modification to the ciphertext results in decryption failure.
- **Integrity Check**: If the recalculated IV matches, and the authentication tag is valid, the decryption proceeds. If the ciphertext has been tampered with, the decryption fails, thereby ensuring data integrity.
- **Final Output**: If decryption is successful, the original plaintext is written to the specified output file.

### Summary of AES-SIV's Security
- **Nonce Misuse Resistance**: Even if a nonce is reused, AES-SIV remains secure, unlike many other encryption modes that become vulnerable if a nonce is reused.
- **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-SIV ensures that the data has not been modified, providing both confidentiality
