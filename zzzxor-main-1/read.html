<h1>Secure XOR Encryption Tool — Explanation of Improvements</h1>

<p>
This document outlines the key enhancements applied to our "secure XOR" approach, how they work, and how to use this updated tool. 
</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Use of <code>OsRng</code> for Nonce Generation</h2>
<p>
Previously, the code used <code>rand::thread_rng()</code> to generate random bytes for nonces. While
<code>thread_rng()</code> typically provides cryptographically secure randomness on most platforms,
it can fall back to a user-space CSPRNG under rare conditions. By using <code>OsRng</code>, we ensure 
the nonce is drawn directly from the operating system's cryptographically secure PRNG source, 
further reducing any chance of weak randomness.
</p>

<h2>2. HKDF-Based Subkey Separation</h2>
<p>
Instead of directly hashing the key file for HMAC, we now employ the 
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5869" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HKDF</a> 
(HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) to derive two separate subkeys:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Encryption Subkey</strong> &mdash; used to generate a keystream.</li>
  <li><strong>HMAC Subkey</strong> &mdash; used for HMAC generation and verification.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This method guarantees cryptographic independence between these two usages of the original key, 
following best-practice key separation principles.
</p>

<h2>3. Zeroizing Sensitive Data</h2>
<p>
Sensitive material like encryption keys, subkeys, and intermediate buffers are explicitly cleared 
from memory (zeroized) after use using the 
<code>zeroize</code> crate. This helps mitigate side-channel or memory-forensics attacks where 
sensitive data might remain in RAM longer than necessary.
</p>

<h2>4. HMAC Verification Before Decryption</h2>
<p>
When decrypting, the HMAC of the input data (except the last 32 bytes which are the HMAC tag) is 
verified before proceeding with the XOR operation. This ensures we never process or output 
plaintext if the data has been tampered with.
</p>

<h2>5. Preventing Overwrites and Basic Path Checks</h2>
<p>
We added a check to ensure that the user does not accidentally overwrite the existing output file 
without an explicit choice. The code now also prevents using the same file path for both input 
and output. These checks reduce the risk of user errors causing data loss.
</p>

<h2>6. (Optional) Streaming I/O for Large Files</h2>
<p>
For clarity, the included code still reads the entire file into memory before processing. In 
practical scenarios involving very large files, we recommend modifying the tool to process data 
in chunks. This would entail reading, encrypting/decrypting, and writing chunks of data while 
continuously updating the HMAC state.
</p>

<h2>How to Use the Tool</h2>
<p>
<strong>1. Build the Project</strong><br/>
Ensure you have a recent version of Rust and Cargo installed. Then open a terminal in the 
project directory and run:
</p>
<pre><code>cargo build --release
</code></pre>

<p>
<strong>2. Run the Encryption Command</strong><br/>
Use <code>E</code> to encrypt:
</p>
<pre><code>./target/release/secure_xor E &lt;input_file&gt; &lt;output_file&gt; &lt;key_file&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;input_file&gt;</code>: The plaintext file to encrypt.</li>
  <li><code>&lt;output_file&gt;</code>: Destination for the resulting ciphertext.</li>
  <li><code>&lt;key_file&gt;</code>: Path to the key file (must be at least as large as <code>&lt;input_file&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>3. Run the Decryption Command</strong><br/>
Use <code>D</code> to decrypt:
</p>
<pre><code>./target/release/secure_xor D &lt;input_file&gt; &lt;output_file&gt; &lt;key_file&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;input_file&gt;</code>: The ciphertext file previously produced.</li>
  <li><code>&lt;output_file&gt;</code>: Where to save the decrypted plaintext.</li>
  <li><code>&lt;key_file&gt;</code>: Same key file used for the encryption.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How the App Works Internally</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Load the Key and Input Data</strong>:
    The tool reads both the key file and your input file (plaintext or ciphertext).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Generate/Extract Nonce</strong>:
    For encryption, the app uses <code>OsRng</code> to produce a new, random 16-byte nonce. For 
    decryption, it extracts the nonce from the first 16 bytes of the ciphertext.
  </li>
  <li><strong>HKDF Key Derivation</strong>:
    The nonce (as salt) plus the user-supplied key file feed into HKDF to produce two subkeys:
    <ul>
      <li>One for generating the keystream (<em>encryption_subkey</em>).</li>
      <li>Another for generating and verifying the HMAC (<em>hmac_subkey</em>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Keystream Generation</strong>:
    A SHA-256-based counter function is used to expand <em>encryption_subkey</em> into a 
    pseudorandom keystream matching the input file’s length. 
  </li>
  <li><strong>XOR with Both Key File &amp; Keystream</strong>:
    The plaintext is first XORed with the key file (byte-for-byte) and then XORed with the 
    generated keystream, making it significantly harder for attackers to exploit typical XOR 
    weaknesses.
  </li>
  <li><strong>HMAC-SHA256 for Integrity</strong>:
    The tool computes an HMAC over the combination of nonce + ciphertext using <em>hmac_subkey</em> 
    and appends it to the output. During decryption, this HMAC is verified before any 
    decryption happens, thwarting tampering attempts.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Zeroizing Sensitive Buffers</strong>:
    After use, the code overwrites memory buffers containing keys and intermediate data to reduce 
    the chance of lingering secrets in RAM.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Key Security Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For true one-time-pad (OTP) properties, the key file must be at least as long as your 
      plaintext, and you should <em>never reuse the same key bytes</em> for different messages.</li>
  <li>Store the key file securely. If an attacker obtains the key file, they can decrypt your data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This updated version provides significantly improved security over basic XOR encryption by 
leveraging modern cryptographic best practices such as HKDF-based subkey separation, strong random 
nonces, HMAC-based integrity, and zeroized key material. While no solution is perfect for all 
use cases, these changes substantially harden the approach against common XOR attacks and 
implementation pitfalls.
